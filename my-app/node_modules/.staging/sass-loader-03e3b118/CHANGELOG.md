<a name="7.0.3"></a>

## [7.0.1](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/compare/v7.0.0...v7.0.1) (2018-04-13)


### Bug Fixes

* Wrong import precedence (#557) ([f4eeff1](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/commit/f4eeff1))



<a name="7.0.0"></a>
# [7.0.0](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/compare/v6.0.7...v7.0.0) (2018-04-13)


### Features

* Refactor resolving and simplify webpack config aliases (#479) ([e0fde1a](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/commit/e0fde1a))
* Remove `node-sass` from `peerDependencies` (#533) ([6439cef](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/commit/6439cef))


### BREAKING CHANGES

* Drop official node 4 support
* This slightly changes the resolving algorithm. Should not break in normal usage, but might break in complex configurations.
* The sass-loader throws an error at runtime now and refuses to compile if the peer dependency is wrong. This could break applications where npm's peer dependency warning was just ignored.
